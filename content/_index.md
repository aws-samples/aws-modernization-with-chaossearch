# ChaosSearch Workshop

{{< youtube _ZQnhA_c1dg >}}

### Welcome
ChaosSearch is an elastic cloud service running on AWS requiring no provisioning or configuration in order to scale -- a true SaaS offering. Raw data is ingested directly from the user's S3 buckets (read-only) and indexed using ChaosSearch IndexÂ® technology back to the user's bucket, transforming S3 storage into a log and event analytics platform.
In this workshop you will learn how ChaosSearch can streamline log processing to take you from raw logs stored in S3 to powerful insights through Kibana, in just a few minutes and without the need to move data or create data pipelines.
