In this workshop we will use ChaosSearch to discover and monitor Elastic Load Balancing (ELB) logs stored in S3. 
The workshop will guide you through hands-on exercises to:

- Discover ELB logs and create an *Object Group* and index using the *Storage* tab
- Create a *View* and transform the data in the *Refinery* tab
- Visualize the data in the *View* using the built-in *Kibana*
- Create an Alert Monitor based on thresholds using *Kibana* and Slack

> **Info:** This workshop is design in a way that each section builds upon the last, so make sure you complete each step before proceeding to the next.
