Each participant will be provided an **AWS** account to use during the event, pre-populated with sample log files required to complete the workshop.
To get access to the account, please follow the instructions below:

1. Use the hashcode provided by AWS team and enter it into [Event Engine - Team Dashboard](https://dashboard.eventengine.run/login).
2. Pick **Email One Time Password OPT**, accept the terms, and login.
3. Check your email for a one-time password to login. Afterward, you will see a dashboard.
4. Click on **Set your Team Name** in the dashboard by entering your name. This will help the workshop support team to help you troubleshoot when you need it.
5. Click on the **AWS Console** button. This will bring up a popup window **AWS Console Login**.
6. Click on **Open AWS Console**. This will log you into the [AWS account](https://<insert_link).
