Congratulations!  You have completed the ChaosSearch Workshop!

### Final Thoughts

We hope that the workshop you completed has given you a better understanding of the ChaosSearch Data Platform and how you can analyze Amazon Elastic Load Balancing (ELB) logs (or logs from any other source) very efficiently without having to build, mantain and troubleshoot ingestion pipelines usually required by traditional log analytics solutions.

Important things to remember:

 - All data in S3 - High-availability and durability
 - No Data Movement & Analyze In-Place
 - True SaaS solution - Fully Managed & Zero Maintenance
