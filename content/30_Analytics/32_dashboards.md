## Dashboards

Dashboards can give near real-time insight into the types of events being logged into your S3 bucket.

Let's combine our saved visualizations to create a dashboard. Select **Dashboard** on the left side menu, then click *Create new dashboard*.

Re-size and re-arrange the visualizations on the dashboard, and hit save when done.
