## Chaos Index速

The ChaosSearch platform is backed by a new and powerful indexing technology, Chaos Index速, an index file format that provides both relational queries and text search in one representation. This format significantly compresses data compared to existing index technologies. Chaos Index速 is uniquely designed to exploit the cost efficiency of object storage such as Amazon S3, while still providing high performance and elastic scale capabilities.

### Start Indexing

Your screen should now look like the following, you can begin indexing by clicking **Start Indexing**:

> **Info:** ChaosSearch dynamically adapts to log changes, for example to include in the index new fields captured in the log files.
